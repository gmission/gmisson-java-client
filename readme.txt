The first version has been completed!!!!
1. how to use it?
Just run the Main class in the package of main. Each run of the main class would post a question and ask you to input the answers. To specify the content of the question, just change the value of the parameters in the first several lines of the main function. After the hit has been posted, a dialog will show up and ask you to input the brief for an answer. It is not necessary for you to post answers for that question, so if you don’t want to do so, just press the “cancel“ button, and the program would end with posting no answers. But if you type in some contents, then another dialog would show up for you to selecT a picture for that answer. Again if you don’t want to do so, just press “cancel” button, then an answer would not have a picture. But if you do select a picture, that picture would be uploaded and server as the picture of that answer. After that you would have successfully posted one answer for the hit posted in the beginning,then the program would continue to ask you for more answers until you press the “cancel“ button.

2.Some important remarks.(please read this before running the program)

2.1 Please do change the value of the variable “photo_directory” defined in the beginning of the “main” function, which is used as the default directory for you to pick up pictures.

2.2 Please make sure that your pictures have extended names, like “menu.png”, otherwise an error would show up for failing to find a picture with name like “menu”.

2.3 The instance “randomAgent” of class “RandomAgent” is used to randomly generate the valid ids for users and locations used in the program. Both requesters and workers are randomly generated by the RandomAgent.getRandomUser(); both locations for hits and answers  area generated by the function RandomAgent.getRandomLocation().  To do so, the randomAgent will first post some users and locations in the construction function for later use. However, it is illegal to create same user multiple times, so if you have already run the program for one time, please set isPosted=true and manually set the start-to-end id in the private fields.

2.4 Classes in “main” package are all written to help run the program, besides, the “org.son” package is also needed for supporting Json operations. However, files in “test” package are some left scripts when writing the program, so they are unnecessary and you can delete them if you like.
